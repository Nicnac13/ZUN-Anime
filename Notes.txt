### Rework notes

- Do not use `vh`, almost ever. It will bug out and look different on every screen.
- Flexbox -> second container to make styling more consisntent, separation of concerns
- Logo -> style a directly to remove 6px ghost pixel height increase
- Sort the styles and contents of styles, as CSS is incredibly hard to read. E.g. all the structural classes together, inside of the class sort coloring/styling separately from the positioning
- Sections: A bit tricky, requires special scroller, since body has to have top padding of 100px.
- Simple and running first, then make it complicated
- Margin from the headers spills out -> padding on the section

### TODOs

- Navbar handling, so that it doesn't have to be copy pasted?
- Sections scroller: Add flex container around sections, fix scrolling.
